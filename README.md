# Retargeting-Humanoid-FAcial-Animations
Creating a system for retargeting humanoid facial animations using computer vision and machine learning involves several key components. Below is a simplified outline of how you might structure your Python code, utilizing popular libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for the machine learning aspect, along with OpenCV for computer vision tasks.
Step 1: Set Up the Environment

Make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:

bash

pip install numpy opencv-python tensorflow torch torchvision

Step 2: Code Structure

Here's a high-level implementation structure for retargeting facial animations.
2.1 Import Required Libraries

python

import cv2
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf  # or import torch if using PyTorch
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

2.2 Define the Data Preprocessing Function

This function will handle loading and preprocessing animation data (e.g., facial landmarks).

python

def load_and_preprocess_data(animation_files):
    data = []
    labels = []
    
    for file in animation_files:
        # Load your animation data (e.g., landmarks)
        # Assuming each file contains facial landmark data in a specific format
        animation_data = np.load(file)  # Placeholder for actual loading method
        data.append(animation_data['landmarks'])  # Example structure
        labels.append(animation_data['target'])  # Target animation data

    return np.array(data), np.array(labels)

2.3 Create a Machine Learning Model

This is a simple neural network model to handle animation retargeting. The architecture can be adjusted based on your specific requirements.

python

def create_model(input_shape):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=input_shape),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, activation='linear')  # Adjust output size based on target
    ])
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
    return model

2.4 Train the Model

Split your data into training and testing sets and train the model.

python

def train_model(data, labels):
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    model = create_model(input_shape=X_train.shape[1:])
    model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.1)
    
    # Evaluate the model
    loss = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
    print(f'Test Loss: {loss}')
    
    return model

2.5 Retargeting Animation Function

Use the trained model to retarget animations based on new input.

python

def retarget_animation(model, new_animation_data):
    # Predict new animation based on model
    retargeted_animation = model.predict(new_animation_data)
    return retargeted_animation

2.6 Main Execution Block

This section ties everything together.

python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example animation file paths (replace with actual paths)
    animation_files = ['animation1.npy', 'animation2.npy']  # Placeholder file paths
    
    data, labels = load_and_preprocess_data(animation_files)
    model = train_model(data, labels)
    
    # Example of retargeting a new animation
    new_animation_data = np.array([[...]])  # Replace with actual new data
    retargeted_animation = retarget_animation(model, new_animation_data)
    
    print("Retargeted Animation:", retargeted_animation)

Final Notes

    Data Preparation: You need a suitable dataset with facial landmark animations. Make sure your data files contain the necessary information in a usable format.

    Model Complexity: The model architecture here is basic. Depending on your dataset's complexity, you may need to experiment with deeper networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or other architectures suitable for time-series data.

    Evaluation: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics for animation quality and accuracy. You might also consider visualizing the retargeted animations to assess the quality subjectively.

    Computer Vision Enhancements: You might also incorporate additional computer vision techniques (e.g., facial detection using OpenCV) if you're working with raw video inputs.

    Fine-tuning: After the initial training, consider fine-tuning the model with more specific datasets to improve performance.

This structure provides a foundational approach for developing a retargeting system for humanoid facial animations. You can expand and refine each component based on your project's specific requirements.
